Every year or so, I use my own site as an opportunity to re-evaluate my current technology-stack and experiment with things that I may not have an opportunity to on an everyday basis.

### Tailwind CSS

Where have the years gone? [Less](http://lesscss.org/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) - the way in which I bring designs to life has changed a lot over the years, but one thing always remained consistent - _writing CSS was a fundamental piece of the equation._

While I had heard of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), I (like many) wasn't completely on-board with a "utility-first" framework. Using Tailwind CSS for this project dispelled a few preconceived notions I had with new lessons-learned:

- **Pseudo selectors are overrated:** To clarify, `::before` and `::after` have their place. I may have gotten caught up in the old adage that the less DOM elements the better, but in the end, it made HTML & CSS harder to visually parse.

  Don't be afraid of writing HTML. Take a look at a component comparison from my previous site:

  ```js filename=BubbleList.old.js
  export const BubbleList = ({ ...opts }) => {
    const theme = useTheme()

    return (
      <List
        css={{
          position: 'relative',

          '&::before, &::after': {
            content: "''",
            zIndex: -1,
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: bubbleSize / 2,
            transform: 'translateX(-50%)',
            background: theme.fontColor.base,
          },

          '&::before': {
            width: bubbleSize / 2,
            height: bubbleSize / 2,
            borderRadius: theme.borderRadius.rounded,
          },

          '&::after': {
            bottom: 0,
            background: theme.fontColor.base,
            width: 2,
          },
        }}
        space="medium"
        {...opts}
      />
    )
  }
  ```

  ```js filename=BubbleList.new.js
  export default function BubbleList({ children, ...rest }) {
    return (
      <div className="relative" {...rest}>
        <div className="absolute top-0 left-2 -translate-x-1/2 h-full z-10">
          <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-slate-900 dark:bg-slate-100 rounded-full absolute top-0 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2" />
          <div className="h-full bg-slate-900 dark:bg-slate-100 w-0.5" />
          <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-slate-900 dark:bg-slate-100 rounded-full absolute bottom-0 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2" />
        </div>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 py-8">{children}</div>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

- **Classes don't make your code messy:** The way in which you use them does. [React](https://reactjs.org); or any templating language like it, provide you a platform to build configurable components that work with Tailwind CSS, not against it. Take a look at the `<Alert />` component for my site:

  ```js filename=Alert.js
  export default function Alert({ variation = 'primary', ...rest }) {
    return (
      <aside
        className={clsx('Alert border-l-8 rounded-lg p-6 my-8', {
          'border-blue-500 bg-blue-100': variation === 'primary',
          'border-red-500 bg-red-100': variation === 'danger',
        })}
        {...rest}
      />
    )
  }
  ```

- **Dark-mode FTW:** This is something I've wanted to explore more, but was always an afterthought with previous design-systems I've built. Tailwind CSS makes this straight-forward with its native [dark-mode support](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode):

  ```markup
  <div className="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-100 bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-900 p-4">Watch me go!</div>
  ```

  For Next.js - I highly recommended [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes); which provides a straight-forward approach.

- **Large site !== large CSS**: Ever since I learned about [Facebook's new CSS approach](https://engineering.fb.com/2020/05/08/web/facebook-redesign/); by generating atomic CSS to keep their bundle-size small, I was curious to see if it could be used in a way that still created a developer/team-friendly approach to managing styles. Again, Tailwind CSS has us covered. With [postcss-purgecss](https://purgecss.com/) integration built-in, an infinitely configurable/extensible setup, and [Intellisense integration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/intellisense), patterns among single-use utility classes quickly become apparent; with this new site coming in under `6kb` - which is just remarkable.

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) has been on my radar for quite some time. After [Next.js Conf 2020](https://nextjs.org/2020/conf), I decided to take the plunge. A few standout features that made this build super enjoyable:

- **getStaticProps**: Having built several projects with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com), I wanted to make sure I could use the same API to grab local data as I would for remote. [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) provided a way for me to query the local filesystem for my blog posts, transform them with [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote), and return the data to the template, statically.
- **Automatic image optimization:** The newly released [Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) component; which comes bundled with the framework, was extremely simple to setup and makes 3rd party solutions for resizing/optimizations unneeded for most cases.
- **âš¡ Fast reloads:** I'm almost at a loss for words here. The increase in speed from save to reload has been a game-changer. [next-remote-watch](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-remote-watch) has also been a valuable addition while writing blog posts locally.

I also moved the hosting over to the parent company, [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) which has yielded `20sec` production-builds ðŸ¤¯

### Conclusion

Is there a conclusion? Probably not. Who knows what types of technologies I'll be working with in the future. But, as of right now, I am incredibly happy with what so many have worked so hard to make available.
