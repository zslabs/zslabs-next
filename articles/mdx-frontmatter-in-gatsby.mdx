[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is an incredible toolkit that allows you to write [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) in your Markdown files; creating opportunities for more dynamic and interactive experiences in your content. An example of how MDX could be used:

```mdx
---
title: My article
---

import Button from '../components/Button'

Here's some **markdown content**.

<Button>React-powered button</Button>
```

When I transitioned this site over to MDX, I immediately went to work creating a better [Code](https://github.com/zslabs/zslabs.com/blob/master/src/components/Code.js) component, and slew of [shortcodes](https://github.com/zslabs/zslabs.com/blob/master/src/components/mdxShortcodes.js) that allowed me to remove a few [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) plugins I wanted to bring in-house.

### The challenge

Storing additional types of data in Markdown frontmatter is a pretty common-practice; especially with CMS solutions like [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). This allows us seperate out chunks you may want to present in different ways - like so:

```mdx filename=article.md
---
title: My article
items:
  - value: Item 1
  - value: Item 2
  - value: Item 3
---

Article content.
```

```js filename=Article.js
const Article = ({ frontmatter, html }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>

    <ul>
      {frontmatter.items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.value}>{item.value}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>

    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />
  </div>
)
```

But - what if you have Markdown content within your frontmatter - or better yet, MDX?

```mdx filename=article.md
---
title: My article
items:
  - value: >-
      Item 1 **value**
  - value: >-
      Item 2

      <Button>React-powered button</Button>
  - value: >-
      Item 3 __value__
---

Article content.
```

Solutions within [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) for normal Markdown frontmatter previously led me down the path of creating a runtime component to parse the Markdown strings that would be queried on the frontend:

```js filename=Data.js
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
import remark from 'remark'
import html from 'remark-html'
import parser from 'html-react-parser'

// Provides a consistent way for us to render content from Markdown frontmatter that propery encodes entities as well
const Data = ({ children }) =>
  parser(remark().use(html).processSync(children).toString())

Data.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,
}

export default Data
```

```js filename=Article.js
import Data from '../components/Data'

const Article = ({ frontmatter, html }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>

    <ul>
      {frontmatter.items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.value}>
          <Data>{item.value}</Data>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>

    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />
  </div>
)
```

The upside to this method was that I could add as many remark plugins as needed - with the obvious downside being the bloat it would add to our bundle. The other downer was `gatsby-remark-*` plugins that may have additional logic inside of `gatsby-browser.js` and `gatsby-ssr.js` wouldn't be accessible in this component. This implementation was never ideal.

With MDX thrown in the mix, [@mdx-js/runtime](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/runtime) was closer to a plugin 'n play solution, but with the downside of being quite large and not recommended for most usecases.

### The solution

After struggling with a few different suggestions across the Gatsby community, I came across [a method](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21789#issuecomment-592110650) that was straight-forward and easy to extend - enter [createSchemaCustomization](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createSchemaCustomization). This allows us to customize Gatsbyâ€™s GraphQL schema by creating type definitions, field extensions or adding third-party schemas.

```js filename=gatsby-node.js
exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({
  actions: { createTypes, createFieldExtension },
  createContentDigest,
}) => {
  createFieldExtension({
    name: 'mdx',
    extend() {
      return {
        type: 'String',
        resolve(source, args, context, info) {
          // Grab field
          const value = source[info.fieldName]
          // Isolate MDX
          const mdxType = info.schema.getType('Mdx')
          // Grab just the body contents of what MDX generates
          const { resolve } = mdxType.getFields().body

          return resolve({
            rawBody: value,
            internal: {
              contentDigest: createContentDigest(value), // Used for caching
            },
            args,
            context,
            info,
          })
        },
      }
    },
  })

  createTypes(`
    type Mdx implements Node {
      frontmatter: MdxFrontmatter
    }

    type MdxFrontmatter {
      items: [ItemValues]
    }

    type ItemValues {
      value: String @mdx
    }
  `)
}
```

The above functionality does a few things:

1. Creates a new, `mdx` field extension that automatically attaches the MDX internals to the fields it is assigned to.
2. Funnels our type definitions down to our specific `items` frontmatter field.
3. Assigns the newly created `mdx` field to our `value`; which is what we want transformed into MDX.

When querying this data with Gatsby's built-in [graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) tool, what's returned is the transformed body content, ready to be consumed by `<MDXRenderer />`.

```js filename=Article.js
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'

import Button from '../components/Button'

const Article = ({ frontmatter, body }) => (
  <MDXProvider components={[Button]}>
    <div>
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>

      <ul>
        {frontmatter.items.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.value}>
            <MDXRenderer>{item.value}</MDXRenderer>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <MDXRenderer>{body}</MDXRenderer>
    </div>
  </MDXProvider>
)
```
