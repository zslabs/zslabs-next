In my [last article](/articles/mdx-frontmatter-in-gatsby/), I wrote about how I was able to parse frontmatter through MDX in Gatsby for a more powerful writing/developer experience. I also mentioned a few [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) plugins I brought in-house. Today, I'll walkthrough how I was able to remove three dependencies for just a few lines of code.

Creating links in Markdown is fairly straightfoward:

```md
[Link](https://www.zslabs.com)
```

With the help of a few plugins, we're able to make these links do a bit more for us automagically:

1. [`remark-external-links`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-external-links): Automatically adds `target` and `rel` attributes to external links.
2. [`remark-relative-links`](https://github.com/zslabs/remark-relative-links): Rewrites absolute URLs to relative ones.
3. [`gatsby-plugin-catch-links`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-catch-links_): Intercepts local links and replaces their behavior with that of the `gatsby-link` [navigate](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/#how-to-use-the-navigate-helper-function).

With MDX's ability to override normal DOM elements, I was able to encapsulate the logic from all three of these plugins into a handy snippet:

```js filename=MarkdownLink.js
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
import { Link as GatsbyLink } from 'gatsby'

// Checks against absolute URLs that share 👇 so we can still pass it along to Gatsby's internal link component
const domainRegex = /http[s]*:\/\/[www.]*YOURDOMAIN\.com[/]?/
// @NOTE We can use a REGEX like this for URLs we want to be treated as external which could be used for Netlify redirects
// /http[s]*:\/\/[www.]*YOURDOMAIN\.com(?!\/i-am-external|\/me-too)[/]?/

const MarkdownLink = ({ href, ...rest }) => {
  const sameDomain = domainRegex.test(href)

  if (sameDomain) {
    href = href.replace(domainRegex, '/')
  }

  if (href.startsWith('/')) {
    return <GatsbyLink data-link-internal to={href} {...rest} />
  }

  // Treat urls that aren't web protocols as "normal" links
  if (!href.startsWith('http')) {
    return <a href={href} {...rest} /> // eslint-disable-line jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content
  }

  return (
    <a
      data-link-external
      href={href}
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
      {...rest}
    />
  )
}

MarkdownLink.propTypes = {
  href: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
}

export default MarkdownLink
```

This can then be passed into `<MDXProvider />` to override default links:

```js filename=Article.js
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'

import MarkdownLink from '../components/MarkdownLink'

const Article = ({ frontmatter, body }) => (
  <MDXProvider
    components={[
      {
        a: (props) => <MarkdownLink {...props} />,
      },
    ]}
  >
    <div>
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>

      <MDXRenderer>{body}</MDXRenderer>
    </div>
  </MDXProvider>
)
```

Since our Markdown links are now powered by a React component, we can apply any other special formatting or logic as needed. Take a look at this one and others I've added to my own site in my [shortcodes file](https://github.com/zslabs/zslabs.com/blob/master/src/components/mdxShortcodes.js). 🎉
